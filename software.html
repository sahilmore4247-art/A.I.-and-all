    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field of computer science
        that focuses on creating intelligent machines capable of thinking, learning,
        and making decisions like humans. AI systems can analyze data, recognize
        patterns, and solve complex problems efficiently.
    </p>

    <p>
        AI is widely used in daily life applications such as voice assistants,
        recommendation systems, facial recognition, self-driving cars, and medical
        diagnosis. It helps in increasing accuracy, reducing human effort, and
        improving productivity.
    </p>

    <p>There are different types of Artificial Intelligence:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Narrow AI:</b> Designed to perform a specific task.</li>
        <li><b>General AI:</b> Performs any intellectual task like a human.</li>
        <li><b>Super AI:</b> More intelligent than humans (theoretical).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Some important branches of AI include Machine Learning, Deep Learning,
        Natural Language Processing, Robotics, and Computer Vision.
